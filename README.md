# super-image-resolution-using-gans-and-transformer-aims-
This project explores image super-resolution using two modern deep learning approaches: SwinIR (a transformer-based model) and a custom GAN-based model. The primary goal is to upscale low-resolution images by a factor of 4 while preserving fine details and texture.
